### 1. Data Processing and Visualization

Create a script that reads a CSV file containing sales data, processes it to calculate monthly trends, and generates a visualization using a charting library.

**Key Requirements:**
- Parse CSV data
- Calculate monthly aggregates
- Create line/bar charts
- Add proper error handling
- Include documentation
```

## Instructions for Copilot:
- Always include filename and path of file to be written when you provide code snippets.
- Always give me full files not snippets
- Always add datatype everywhere in code where possible.
- use requirements.txt for dependencies.
- split code into multiple files if applicable to maintain modularity.
- write modern Python code using type hints.
- always include tests for the code you write.
- when you update code, always update the tests accordingly.
- I start in a blank python venv. Inform me about any packages you need to install.
